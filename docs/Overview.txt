### Overview of the PlaceMates Project Features

Let's break down your requirements and the implementation approach, step-by-step.

---

### 1. **Register Page**

**Features:**
- **Form Fields**: 
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - User Type (Admin or Student)
  - Email
  - Password

**Frontend:**
- A registration form that collects the user's first name, last name, user type, email, and password.
- Validate input fields for proper format (e.g., valid email format).
- **User Type** should be a dropdown (Admin/Student).
- On submit, send the registration request to the backend API.

**Backend:**
- **User Registration Endpoint**:
  - Backend should validate the uniqueness of the email (ensure no existing user has the same email).
  - Hash the password before storing it (using something like **BCrypt**).
  - Save the user’s data into the database (including their role: Admin or Student).

---

### 2. **Login Page**

**Features:**
- **Form Fields**: 
  - Email
  - Password
  - Forgot Password (a link for resetting password)

**Frontend:**
- A login form with email and password fields.
- A "Forgot Password" link that routes to a password reset page (if you choose to implement one).
- On submit, send the login credentials to the backend for authentication.

**Backend:**
- **Login Endpoint**:
  - Backend should authenticate using the **JWT** token mechanism.
  - Validate the user’s credentials (email and password).
  - If valid, generate and return a JWT token.
- **JWT Authentication**:
  - After successful login, the backend should issue a JWT token that can be used for further requests requiring authentication.
  - The JWT should be stored in local storage (or cookies) on the frontend.

---

### 3. **Home Page**

**Features:**
- A **landing page** introducing the application.
- Show general information like:
  - **Overview of PlaceMates**: What it offers (for students, alumni, companies).
  - **Login and Register Links** for new users or returning users.
  - **Search Bar** to allow users to search for companies, alumni, or other information available (especially useful if the homepage features a listing of recent companies or alumni).
- A **hero section** with prominent call-to-action buttons like “Sign Up” and “Log In”.
- **Company/Alumni Highlights**: Show some of the top companies or alumni.

**Frontend:**
- Display a hero section with a call to action.
- Display a search bar for users to search through data (companies, alumni).
- Maybe a **carousel** or **featured section** for companies and alumni.

**Backend:**
- Optionally, you could have a **latest companies** or **top alumni** section, where the backend API sends the top N results based on some ranking or relevance.

---

### 4. **Profile Page**

**Features:**
- Display user information such as:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email
  - User Type (Admin/Student)
- Ability to update information (like email, password).
- Option to change the **theme** between **light** or **dark mode** (preferably persisted in user settings).

**Frontend:**
- **Theme Toggle**: Implement a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes. Use local storage or state management to persist the theme across page reloads.
- **Profile Information**: Allow users to update their **email** and **password**.
- **Logout**: A logout button to clear user session and token from local storage (or cookies).

**Backend:**
- **Update Profile Endpoint**: Implement an API endpoint that allows users to update their profile information like email and password. For password changes, ensure it’s validated and hashed again before being stored.
- **Logout**: No backend action needed for logout; it's handled by the frontend where the JWT token is deleted from local storage or cookies.
- **Theme**: The theme preference can be stored locally in the frontend, but you could also store it in the backend if needed (though it’s not strictly necessary).

---

### 5. **About Page**

**Features:**
- A page containing information about PlaceMates.
  - Mission, vision, and purpose of the platform.
  - How it works for students, alumni, and companies.
  - Contact information and maybe social media links.

**Frontend:**
- A static page with text, images, or videos describing PlaceMates.
- Contact form or links to social media.

**Backend:**
- **Static Content**: This is likely static, so no backend implementation is required unless you want to manage content dynamically (e.g., update mission/vision from an admin panel).

---

### 6. **Alumni Page**

**Features:**
- **For Students**: Read-only access to view alumni details.
- **For Admins**: Full CRUD operations to create, update, delete alumni information.

**Frontend:**
- **For Students**: Display alumni data in a **list** or **cards** with basic information like name, branch, company, etc.
- **For Admins**: Show **CRUD options** (Edit, Delete) alongside each alumni entry.
- Search bar for students to search alumni by name, company, or batch.

**Backend:**
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement endpoints for:
  - **Create** new alumni records.
  - **Read** alumni data (for students and admins).
  - **Update** alumni information (e.g., updating job status, current company).
  - **Delete** alumni records.
- For updating alumni information, you can provide a form where the admin selects only the fields they wish to modify (not all fields).

---

### **Updating Alumni Information (Admin)**

#### Ways to implement the update method without directly using the object:
- **Field-by-field update**: Instead of passing the entire alumni object to update, the admin can update specific fields (e.g., job title, current company, etc.). The admin would be presented with a form where they can select only the fields they want to modify.
- **Partial Update (PATCH)**: Use an API that accepts a **partial object** (e.g., just `job_title`, `company_name`), ensuring that only the necessary fields are updated in the backend.
- **Modal/Popup Forms**: On the frontend, you can use a modal or popup that only includes fields for updating specific information (e.g., job title, CTC) rather than the full form for the alumni object.

---

### 7. **Company Page**

**Features:**
- **For Students**: Read-only access to view company details (name, CTC, job description, etc.).
- **For Admins**: Full CRUD operations to create, update, and delete company details.

**Frontend:**
- **For Students**: Display a list or cards of companies with basic details.
- **For Admins**: Show CRUD options (Edit, Delete) beside each company entry.
- Search bar for companies by name, CTC, job title, or location.

**Backend:**
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement API endpoints to:
  - **Create** new companies.
  - **Read** company details (for students and admins).
  - **Update** company information (e.g., job description, CTC).
  - **Delete** companies.
  
---

### **Updating Company Information (Admin)**

#### Ways to implement the update method without directly using the object:
- **Field-by-field update**: Similar to alumni, admins can select specific fields to update (e.g., only update job description or CTC).
- **Partial Update (PATCH)**: A `PATCH` request where only the fields the admin wants to change are provided (e.g., `ctc`, `job_description`).
- **Dynamic Forms**: Use a dynamic form that only displays fields that need to be updated based on the admin's selections (e.g., "Update Company CTC" form with just the CTC field).

---

### Additional Features to Consider

1. **Pagination**: Implement pagination on the Alumni and Company pages to improve performance when displaying large lists of records.
2. **Search with Filters**: Enhance the search functionality with advanced filters (e.g., filter companies by location, CTC, or branch for alumni).
3. **Notifications**: Implement notifications to inform users when new companies or alumni join, or when a new job opportunity is posted.
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Provide admins with a dashboard to manage all users, companies, and alumni in a more centralized way.
5. **Email Verification**: Implement email verification during registration to ensure valid email addresses.
6. **Password Recovery**: Implement a password reset functionality where users can reset their password if they forget it.

### Backend vs. Frontend Breakdown

#### **Frontend Responsibilities**:
- UI for user interaction.
infinite loading/scroll
- Forms for registration, login, profile update.
- Displaying lists of alumni, companies, and CRUD options for admins.
- Handling JWT tokens for user authentication.
- Managing theme switching and user preferences locally (like dark mode).
- Handling client-side validation (e.g., for email format, password strength).
  
#### **Backend Responsibilities**:
- User authentication and JWT token generation. and hashing for password storage/google real mail authentication
cloud for database and storGE
- Storing and retrieving user, company, and alumni data from the database.
- Validating input (e.g., ensuring unique emails during registration).
- Implementing the **CRUD operations** for both companies and alumni.
- Managing permissions (e.g., restricting CRUD operations to admins only).
- Managing email verification and password recovery.

### Conclusion

Each of these pages has specific frontend and backend responsibilities, with the frontend focusing on user experience (UI/UX) and the backend handling

 the data management, authentication, and business logic. By separating these concerns, you can ensure that your app is both efficient and user-friendly.
